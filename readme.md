# Romanize!

## Objective
Create a function that accepts an integer as an argument. It should than convert that number into its roman numeral equivalent.

```
2499 = MMCDXCIX
543 = DXLIII
13 = XIII
```

### Pairing!
You can do this challenge in either JS or Ruby. Pair with someone that wants to code in the same language as you. Ideally someone you've never worked with before!

### Pseudo Code!(10m)
No one is allowed to code for the first 10 minutes. Start writing down/typing how to break this problem down.

### Code!

### Bonus - Refactor to JS(if you coded in ruby) and create a website that converts roman numerals!
